# Book-WebScraper

Project from November 2022 that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the author, page count, the book cover image, book summary, and Goodreads rating from the book title.
Uses a command line interface format; each attribute can be turned on or off as needed.

As of August 2023, no longer works as Goodreads html tags have been updated.
