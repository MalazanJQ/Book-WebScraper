# Book-WebScraper

Project from November 2022 that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the author, page count, the book cover image, book summary, and Goodreads rating from the book title.
Uses a command line interface format; each attribute can be turned on or off as needed to tailor gathered attributes as desired.

As of August 2023, no longer works as Goodreads html tags have been updated but video below demonstrates its previous functionality.
