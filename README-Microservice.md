Microservice Instructions:

To request data from the microservice, open the blank text file "zip-service.txt" in write mode and write a number onto the file using the write() method, then close the file.

To receive data from the microservice, open the blank text file "zip-service.txt" in read mode and copy the resulting string into a variable using the readline() method.
